Media: YouTube Custom Poster Frame

This module adds the ability to use a custom poster frame image for
YouTube videos in climate.gov's "News & Features Video" content type.

At present, this module is specifically tailored for the
news_features_video content type on climate.gov, and it depends on
that content type having a field of type "Image" whose machine name is
'poster_frame_image'.  You must manually add that field to
news_features_video content type in order for this module to work.
